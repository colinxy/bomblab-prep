#+TITLE: Bomblab Preparation


* Intro

This project aims to duplicate the behavior the actual bomblab.
It serves as a simplified version of bomblab. Just as the actual
bomblab, you get a program with several phases of bombs, and you
have to type the correct string to defuse the bomb.

But unlike the actual bomblab, you can try as many times as you want,
and there is no consequence of exploding the bomb.

The goal of this program is to give you a easier program
to start with, without the fear of losing points on your
actual lab.


* Running the program

All code are expected to run in command line under a *nix system.

First create the bomb with =make=, and you will find an executable
with the name =bomb_prep=. Then practice defusing the bomb with
=gdb bomb_prep=.
